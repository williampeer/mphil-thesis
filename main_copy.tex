\chapter{Introduction}

The preliminary material of your report should contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The title page.
\item
An abstract page.
\item
Optionally an acknowledgements page.
\item
The table of contents.
\end{itemize}

As in this example \texttt{skeleton.tex}, the above material should be
included between:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{preliminary}
    ...
\end{preliminary}
\end{verbatim}
This style file uses roman numeral page numbers for the preliminary material.

The main content of the dissertation, starting with the first chapter,
starts with page~1. \emph{\textbf{The main content must not go beyond page~40.}}

The report then contains a bibliography and any appendices, which may go beyond
page~40. The appendices are only for any supporting material that's important to
go on record. However, you cannot assume markers of dissertations will read them.

You may not change the dissertation format (e.g., reduce the font
size, change the margins, or reduce the line spacing from the default
1.5 spacing). Over length or incorrectly-formatted dissertations will
not be accepted and you would have to modify your dissertation and
resubmit.  You cannot assume we will check your submission before the
final deadline and if it requires resubmission after the deadline to
conform to the page and style requirements you will be subject to the
usual late penalties based on your final submission time.

\section{Using Sections}

Divide your chapters into sub-parts as appropriate.

\section{Citations}

Citations (such as \cite{P1} or \cite{P2}) can be generated using
\texttt{BibTeX}. For more advanced usage, the \texttt{natbib} package is
recommended. You could also consider the newer \texttt{biblatex} system.

These examples use a numerical citation style. You may also use
(Author, Date) format if you prefer.

\chapter{Your next chapter}

A dissertation usually contains several chapters.

\chapter{Conclusions}

\section{Final Reminder}

The body of your dissertation, before the references and any appendices,
\emph{must} finish by page~40. The introduction, after preliminary material,
should have started on page~1.

You may not change the dissertation format (e.g., reduce the font
size, change the margins, or reduce the line spacing from the default
1.5 spacing). Over length or incorrectly-formatted dissertations will
not be accepted and you would have to modify your dissertation and
resubmit.  You cannot assume we will check your submission before the
final deadline and if it requires resubmission after the deadline to
conform to the page and style requirements you will be subject to the
usual late penalties based on your final submission time.
